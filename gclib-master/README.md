## GCLib - Genomic C++/Code Library
This is an eclectic gathering of (mostly) C++ code which I am using for some of my bioinformatics projects. 
The main idea is to provide lean code and efficient data structures, trying to avoid too many code 
dependencies of heavy libraries while minimizing production cycles (and this also implies a decent compile/build time -- 
I am looking at you, bloated configure scripts and lengthy compile times of Boost code or other heavy C++ template code..).

I had started gathering this code even before the C++ STL had been fully adopted as a cross-platform "standard", and because 
I also think that STL by itself is a bit heavier for most of my C++ needs, I do prefer to use simpler&leaner C++ 
classes or templates for basic strings, containers, basic algorithms etc.
