I’d like to describe how the Single Transferable Vote (multi-winner Ranked Choice Voting) serves the idea of representative politics. In particular, I’m going to describe how

every voter can have an equitable share of power,
candidates are responsive to the voters that put them in power, and
candidates can work together on campaigns,
This differs from our current district-based single-winner single-choice voting method, where

voters often feel their vote is wasted, and
candidates are antagonistic towards each other during campaigns.
I’m also going to describe other mechanically similar voting methods that achieve the same goals.
